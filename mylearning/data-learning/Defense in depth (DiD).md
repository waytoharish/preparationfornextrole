Defense in depth (DiD) is ==an information security strategy that uses multiple layers of security measures to protect an organization's assets==: 

- **Layered security**
DiD uses multiple security measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and behavioral analysis, to protect against attacks. 
- **Redundancy**
DiD creates redundancy by implementing complementary security measures across layers of the IT stack. This makes the IT stack more resilient to attacks. 
-**Slowing the attacker**
 DiD is designed to slow down an attacker so that the organization has time to detect and deal with the attack. 
**Addressing human error**
DiD addresses security vulnerabilities in people, as human error is often the cause of a security breach. 
    
DiD can be applied to all levels of IT systems, from a single laptop to a large enterprise WAN. Some examples of DiD components include: 

- Firewall
- WAF
- Secure web gateway
- IDS/IPS
- EDR software
- Anti-malware software
- API Security Platform
- DDoS Attack Protection
- MFA
- Cloud WAF
