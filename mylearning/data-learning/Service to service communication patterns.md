Service to service communication patterns" ==refers to the different methods and protocols used for data exchange between various services within a distributed system==

**Request-Response (Synchronous):**

- A service sends a request to another service and waits for a response before proceeding. 
- Commonly used for simple operations requiring immediate feedback. 
- Examples: REST API calls, gRPC with synchronous invocation

**Message Queuing (Asynchronous):**

- A service publishes a message to a queue, and one or more interested services can consume the message later at their own pace. 
- Useful for decoupling services, handling high volume of messages, and implementing event-driven architectures. 
- Examples: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS

- **Publish-Subscribe:** A variation of message queuing where services subscribe to specific topics and receive messages only related to those topics.
- **Fanout:** A message is broadcast to all subscribed services.
- **Direct Exchange:** A message is sent to a single specific queue based on a routing


Factors to Consider When Choosing a Communication Pattern:

- **Latency Requirements:** If immediate response is needed, choose synchronous communication. 
- **Scalability:** Asynchronous patterns are often better for high-volume scenarios. 
- **Coupling:** Asynchronous communication can help achieve looser coupling between services.
