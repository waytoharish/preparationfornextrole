GitOps is ==a framework that uses Git as a source control system to manage infrastructure and application code deployments==. It's a DevOps best practice that's based on the idea that Git is the only source of truth for a system. GitOps can help with a variety of tasks, including: 

- **Infrastructure automation**: GitOps automates the process of provisioning infrastructure. 
- **Continuous deployment**: GitOps can automate the deployment of new applications or updates to existing ones. 
- **Configuration management**: GitOps tools monitor the system for configuration drifts and can automatically reconcile the system back to the desired state. 

- **Version control**: GitOps stores the desired state of the system in version control, making it easy to audit changes. 

- **Security**: GitOps can help secure the management of secrets across deployments. 

GitOps is often used for Kubernetes and cloud-native application development. It can be used in other infrastructure environments as well. 

Some benefits of GitOps include: Improved efficiency and security, A better developer experience, Reduced costs, and Faster deployments
