# Gitlab SSH Key setup

**1. ✅ Step 1: Open Git Bash (or any terminal that supports SSH)**
If you don't have Git Bash installed, download it here:
👉 https://git-scm.com/downloads

After installing, right-click on your desktop or open Start Menu → Search “Git Bash” → Open it.

**2. ✅ Step 2: Generate SSH Key**
In Git Bash, run this command (replace your email):

```bash

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
If you get an error about ed25519 being unsupported, use this instead:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
You will see prompts:

Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519):
👉 Press Enter to accept the default path.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
👉 Optional: Type a passphrase, or press Enter twice to leave it empty.

You’ll get confirmation like:

Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**3. ✅ Step 3: Start the SSH Agent**
Still in Git Bash, run:

```bash

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Start the agent if not already running:


ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
(Or use id_rsa if you chose RSA)
```

4. ✅ Step 4: Copy the Public Key to Clipboard
Run this command to copy:

```bash

clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Now your public SSH key is in your clipboard.

5. ✅ Step 5: Add SSH Key to GitLab
Go to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/

Sign in to your account.

In the top-right corner, click your profile picture → Edit profile.

On the left sidebar, go to SSH Keys.

Paste the key into the "Key" field.

Add a Title like “Windows Laptop SSH” and optionally set an expiration date.

Click Add key.

6. ✅ Step 6: Test the SSH Connection
In Git Bash, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -T git@gitlab.com
Expected output:

bash
Copy
Edit
Welcome to GitLab, @yourusername!
✅ Bonus: Set Git to Use SSH for GitLab
Make sure your Git remote uses the SSH URL. To check:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote -v
If it shows https://, change it to SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:username/repository.git

# Explanation of gitlab to local Connection

1. 🔑 1. You Generated SSH Keys
When you ran ssh-keygen, two files were created:

File	Type	Purpose
id_ed25519 (or id_rsa)	Private	Stays on your local machine. Used to prove your identity.
id_ed25519.pub	Public	Shared with servers (like GitLab) so they can recognize you.

These two form a key pair used in public-key cryptography.

🔁 2. You Copied the Public Key to GitLab
When you paste the public key in GitLab:

GitLab stores it and links it to your user account.

Whenever a connection attempt is made, GitLab can challenge the connecting client to prove they hold the matching private key.

This is how SSH authentication works:

GitLab → sends a random challenge to your machine.

Your SSH client signs it using your private key.

GitLab verifies it using the public key you uploaded.

If it matches → you're authenticated.

🔐 GitLab never sees your private key. It only knows your public key.

👤 3. You Started the SSH Agent
The SSH Agent is a background process that holds your private keys in memory.

Why?

So you don't have to re-enter the passphrase every time you use SSH.

It supplies your key automatically when an SSH connection is made (e.g., for git clone, git push).

When you run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
You're loading your private key into the agent. It will now respond to GitLab’s authentication challenge automatically.

🔌 4. GitLab Connection Flow (Simplified)
Here’s what happens when you run git clone git@gitlab.com:username/repo.git:

Git tries to connect to git@gitlab.com over SSH.

GitLab receives the connection request and checks:

Is there an SSH key on file for this user?

GitLab sends a challenge.

Your SSH agent signs it using your private key.

GitLab verifies the signature using the public key you uploaded.

✅ Access granted if the keys match.

No password is exchanged — it's all key-based.

🛑 5. Do You Need to Stop the SSH Agent?
Short answer: No, you don't have to stop it.
The agent is lightweight and doesn’t constantly run unless needed.

On Windows, it's managed by the OS as a background service.

If you're concerned about security or just not using Git/SSH, you can stop it manually:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Stop-Service ssh-agent
