**🧠 First: What Is a “Core” in Spark?**
A core represents a CPU thread available to Spark for running one task at a time.

If you give an executor 4 cores, it can run 4 tasks in parallel.

More cores = more parallelism per executor.

**🎯 Your Goal as a Spark Tuner**
✅ Maximize resource utilization without overwhelming your executor's memory or the cluster’s physical limits.

So, picking the number of cores per executor means balancing:

Parallelism (how many tasks run at once)

Memory per task (each core shares the executor’s memory)

Cluster capacity (how many total cores your cluster has)

🧮 Step-by-Step: How to Choose Cores per Executor
Let’s assume this scenario:

🔧 Cluster Resources:
Resource Value
Total nodes 10
Cores per node 16
Memory per node 64 GB

⚙️ Step 1: Decide memory per executor
Say we want:

```java
executor memory = 16 GB
```

**⚙️ Step 2: Estimate memory per task (core)**
From earlier:

Spark reserves about 40% memory for shuffle/cache/etc.

So usable memory for tasks = 0.6 * 16 GB = ~9.6 GB

Let’s say each task (per core) needs ~2.4 GB:

9.6 GB usable / 2.4 GB per task = 4 tasks
→ Choose 4 cores per executor

✅ So 4 cores per executor is a good choice here.

⚙️ Step 3: Fit executors into a node
Now each executor:

uses 16 GB memory

uses 4 cores

A node has:

64 GB total → 64 / 16 = 4 executors per node

16 cores total → 16 / 4 = 4 executors per node

✅ That fits nicely.

🚀 What Happens When You Add More Cores per Executor?
Pros:

More parallel tasks on each executor

Less overhead (fewer JVMs to launch/manage)

Cons:

More memory pressure per executor

Garbage collection pauses (GC pauses longer with more memory + tasks)

If one task hangs, more tasks are delayed (co-location issue)

✅ Ideal Config Rule of Thumb
Executor Config Reason
4–5 cores per executor | Best GC behavior, stable
4–8 GB memory per core Avoid OOM
1 executor per node (large memory) OR 2–4 (smaller)    Depends on workload

🧮 Sample Formula

```text

executor_cores = usable_executor_memory / memory_needed_per_task
```

Then make sure:

```text

num_executors_per_node = min(
total_memory_per_node / executor_memory,
total_cores_per_node / executor_cores
)
🛠 Example Final Config

--executor-cores 4 \
--executor-memory 16G \
--num-executors 20
➡️ This gives you:

4 tasks per executor

20 executors total = 80 parallel tasks

Good memory spread, decent GC performance
```

✅ Summary
Term Meaning
Core |1 CPU thread, can run 1 task
Executor cores |Parallelism per executor
Too few cores |Low parallelism, under-utilized CPUs
Too many cores GC pauses, memory pressure, instability
Sweet spot 4–5 cores/executor for balanced performance

**Manan's own understanding**

Problem: Find the executor cores

Formula:
num_executors_per_node = min(
total_memory_per_node / executor_memory,
total_cores_per_node / executor_cores
)

Things to find out
Assuming parallelism per executor = 4
Executor memory = Task memory * parallelism per executor

- Executor Memory ---> ???
    - Task Memory
        - Partition Size
            - Total Data volume
            - No of partitions
- Executor Core
    - Can start with 4

Prequisites to know:

- Node configuration --> CPU , Memory
- Executor Memory
    - Task size
        - total file size
