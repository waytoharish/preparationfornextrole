ðŸ“¦ Problem Recap
Your Job:
Read 20 GB from employees/

Read 30 GB from employeescommits/

Join on employeeID

Aggregate commit counts per employee per project

Run on Spark (e.g., EMR, Glue, or Databricks)

ðŸ§® Step-by-Step Executor Memory Calculation
ðŸ”¢ Step 1: Estimate total data size after shuffle
Source Volume
employees 20 GB
employeescommits 30 GB
Total read 50 GB
Join output Estimated: ~40 GB
Aggregated output Small (e.g., ~1â€“5 GB)

ðŸ§  Rule of thumb: joins + shuffles cause 1.5xâ€“3x data growth temporarily.

ðŸ”¹ Letâ€™s assume:

```text

Peak memory = 50 GB read + 40 GB shuffle temp + some buffer
= ~100 GB total memory used across all tasks
ðŸ”¢ Step 2: Estimate Number of Tasks (Partitions)
Spark will default to spark.sql.shuffle.partitions = 200 unless overridden.
```

You can control partitions based on 128 MB target partition size:

```text

50 GB / 128 MB â‰ˆ 400 partitions (tasks)
Letâ€™s assume we use 400 tasks (this gives better parallelism).
```

ðŸ”¢ Step 3: Decide Memory Per Task
Each task will handle 128 MB read + additional memory for:

Join state

Shuffle buffer

Object overhead

ðŸ”¹ Typical memory per task: 300â€“400 MB

ðŸ”¢ Step 4: Decide Number of Cores Per Executor
Letâ€™s choose 4 cores per executor for optimal balance:

4 tasks per executor run in parallel

So memory per executor must support 4 tasks

```text

4 tasks Ã— 400 MB = 1.6 GB usable memory
But this is only the task memory, we need to account for Spark overhead.
```

**ðŸ§® Step 5: Apply Spark Memory Layout**
Spark Memory Component Usage
spark.executor.memory Memory available to tasks
spark.memory.fraction 60% default for execution/storage (rest is JVM overhead)
Overhead (spark.executor.memoryOverhead)    Typically 384 MBâ€“512 MB

ðŸ”§ Calculate:

```text
Executor usable task memory = executor_memory * 0.6
executor_memory = usable_memory / 0.6 = 1.6 / 0.6 â‰ˆ 2.7 GB
Add overhead (512 MB)
Final executor size â‰ˆ 3.2 GB â†’ round to 4 GB
```

**âœ… Final Recommended Configuration**
Setting Value Reason
--executor-memory 4 GB To support 4 parallel tasks
--executor-cores 4 One task per core
--spark.sql.shuffle.partitions 400 Based on 50 GB input size
Executors ceil(400 / 4) = 100 To run 400 tasks in parallel

**ðŸ§¾ Summary Table**
Resource Value
Total input data    ~50 GB
Total tasks 400
Cores per executor 4
Memory per task 300â€“400 MB
Executor memory    ~4 GB
Number of executors    ~100

âœ… Spark Submit Example

```bash

spark-submit \
--executor-memory 4g \
--executor-cores 4 \
--num-executors 100 \
--conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=400 \
your_script.py
```

**ðŸ“Œ Optional Tuning Tips**
Situation Tip
Small joins Use broadcast() to avoid shuffle
Fewer executors available Increase executor-cores, reduce parallelism
Agg stage outputs small result Use .coalesce(10) before write
Spill in shuffle seen in logs Increase spark.memory.fraction or executor memory
