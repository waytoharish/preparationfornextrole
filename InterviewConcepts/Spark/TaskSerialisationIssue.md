**Issue**: Task Serialisation issue

**Resulting Error:**
_pickle.PicklingError: Cannot pickle files that are not opened for reading: w

**Java Equivalent Error:**
org.apache.spark.SparkException: Task not serializable

**Reason** : Task not serializable-type error, but in PySpark it appears as a PicklingError,
because Spark uses Python‚Äôs pickle (or cloudpickle) to serialize closures and ship them to worker nodes.

**#Spark in Scala/Java #Spark in Python**
Task not serializable             _pickle.PicklingError
java.io.NotSerializable TypeError / PicklingError

**Explanation:**

üîç What Spark Is Doing Internally

1. Driver
   The code runs on the Spark Driver (your laptop, or Glue job driver node). When Spark sees:

python
Copy
Edit
rdd.map(processor.multiply)
it has to send that function (multiply) to Executors (worker nodes) to run in parallel on the data.

2. Serialization
   To do this, Spark:

Serializes the function and its context (called the closure) using Python‚Äôs pickle or Java‚Äôs Kryo (depending on
language).

In Python, this includes any object variables it touches. So here, processor.multiply closes over self.logger.

üî¥ Problem: self.logger = open("dummy.log", "w") is a file handle ‚Äî and file handles can't be pickled (serialized).

Thus you get:

_pickle.PicklingError: Cannot pickle files that are not opened for reading: w

**üî• Why This Is a Problem**
Executors cannot execute your code unless they receive a serializable version of it.

Imagine the following:

Component Responsibility
Driver Defines what work to do (map, filter)
Executor Runs the actual transformations on data
Serialization How driver sends the function to workers

So when Spark serializes your processor.multiply, it also tries to serialize self.logger (a file handle) ‚Äî which fails,
and Spark can't send your logic to the executors. Job fails before any actual computation happens.

üî• Why This Is a Problem in Spark
Let‚Äôs say your code looks like this:

class MyLogger:
def __init__(self):
self.log = open("log.txt", "w")  # This is a file handle

    def log_and_process(self, x):
        self.log.write(f"{x}\n")
        return x * 2

logger = MyLogger()
rdd.map(logger.log_and_process)
When Spark tries to serialize logger.log_and_process, it also needs to serialize:

The logger object

Which contains self.log

Which is a file handle

‚ùå But file handles can't be serialized ‚Äî they represent a live connection to a file, not data.

Thus, you get:

PicklingError: Can't pickle file objects
Even if Spark could somehow serialize it, the executor would be on a different machine, and might not even have access
to the same file system!

üß† Think of It Like This:
Sending a file handle from your machine to an executor is like giving someone a remote control without giving them the
TV.

**Extention to the above explanation:**

üí° Your Statement:
"__init__ works the very moment when the object is created. Since the object is created at the driver, the pointer (file
handle) gets opened at the driver."

‚úÖ This is 100% correct.
üß† Why This Happens: Spark Architecture Context
Step-by-step:
Driver Program (your local code):

Runs on your local machine or cluster's driver node.

This is where you define functions, classes, create RDDs/DataFrames, etc.

When you create an object like:

python
Copy
Edit
processor = Processor()
__init__() is immediately executed on the Driver.

If inside __init__() you open a file:

python
Copy
Edit
self.logger = open("dummy.log", "w")
The file is opened on the Driver machine only.

Now the object processor contains a live file handle ‚Äî which is OS-specific and not serializable.

When Spark sees:

python
Copy
Edit
rdd.map(processor.multiply)
It tries to serialize processor (including the logger).

This fails because the file handle inside the object can‚Äôt be serialized and sent to workers.

üî• Visual Analogy:
Component Where it lives Can it travel to worker?
processor Created on Driver ‚úÖ if all fields are serializable
self.logger Open file on Driver ‚ùå Cannot be sent to workers
__init__()    Runs on Driver only ‚úÖ Yes (but must avoid non-serializable ops)

‚úÖ What This Means for You as a Data Engineer
Rule Why
‚úÖ Initialize only serializable data in __init__()    Safe to distribute across Spark
‚ùå Don‚Äôt open files, DB connections, or sockets in __init__()    These are local system resources ‚Äî not transferable to
workers

TODO:
Things to replicate:
Would you like to simulate another failure next?
I suggest:

‚ùóStage retry due to task crash

üí• Skew join timeout / spilling

üö´ File read/write failure (e.g., missing S3 path)
