[Bulb/ESP32] ←→ [Local WiFi] ←→ [Laptop]
   192.168.1.100        192.168.1.5
   
Simple HTTP or MQTT:
- Basic authentication (if needed)
- Username/password is enough
- Same network communication

# Basic analogy of AWS IOT core

### Key Points:

1. AWS IoT SDK = MQTT Client Library + AWS specific features (certs, reconnect, shadows)
2. AWS IoT Core = Managed Mosquitto Broker + AWS Features (rules, security, scaling)

### Think of it as:

1. Mosquitto = Basic email server you manage
2. AWS IoT Core = Gmail with extra features (managed, secure, scalable)

# Comparison in differnt clouds

all three cloud providers have similar IoT solutions. Here's a comparison:

```pgsql
AWS IoT:

    
[Device] → [AWS IoT SDK] → [AWS IoT Core (MQTT Broker)] → [AWS Services]

    

    
Azure IoT:

    
[Device] → [Azure IoT SDK] → [Azure IoT Hub (MQTT Broker)] → [Azure Services]

    

    
Google Cloud IoT:

    
[Device] → [Google IoT SDK] → [Cloud IoT Core (MQTT Broker)] → [GCP Services]

    
```
    
### Common Features Across All:

1. Device Management
2. Security/Certificates
3. Message Routing
4. Cloud Integration

### Key Differences in Names:

    
Feature          | AWS          | Azure        | GCP
-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------
Core Service     | IoT Core     | IoT Hub      | Cloud IoT Core*
Device State     | Device Shadow| Device Twin  | Device State
Rules Engine     | Rules Engine | Message Routes| Cloud Functions
